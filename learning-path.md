# LEARNING PATH: INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & ENTREPENEURSHIP
_At the conclusion of my learning path I will have gained sufficient knowledge to plan, execute, and launch my own ecommerce business. My goal is to create two loosely-dependent pieces of software. The program goes into depth on a variety of subjects related to information technology, management, and entrepeneruship. A non-exhaustive list is as follows: User experience research methods and cognitivie psychology; Computer science and information sciences; Multi-disclininary design and design thinking in practice; Business management and global economics; Digital marketing and entrepeneurship; and Information technology management._

### Program Structure
---

_Core compotencies span several topics, and each **topic** includes sub-topics called **modules**, and for every module there will be several **units** focusing on a specific area of study. Each unit will be futher broken down into **lessons** or **lectures** with attached materials for further examination. Each course is accompanied by a "project" which includes a presentation (guided-project tutorial), a technical paper (including blog posts). If a widely-accepted certification is available for the topic, then that will be included in the module as well. For example [Core Competency > Topic > Module > Unit > Lesson > Asset.]_  

* Summary or description:
    - Summarize the topic of study, core competencies covered, skills learned, tools used, and estimated completion time.
    - Provide links to resources and assign tags for project tracking

* Course objective(s):
    - Project, technical paper, blog post, presentation

* Difficulty:
    - Each course is assigned a difficult rating or either, beginner, intermediate, advanced, or mixed. The estimated time for each course.

* Course unit measurement:
    - For beginner level courses, one (1) unit is equal to 2 hrs of study per day, 5 days per week, or (1x-base) difficulty; For intermediate level courses, one (1) unit is equal to 4 hrs of study per day, 5 days per week, or (~2x-base) difficulty; For advanced level courses, one (1) unit is equal to 8 hrs of study per day, 5 days per week, or (~4x-base) difficulty.

* Course progress and timeline:
    - Progress can be tracked live on a central repository > [here]()
    - Timeline > [here]()
    
* Quarter system:
    - There will be four sessions throughout the year which coincides with the seasons for simplicities sake. Each session will last ~3 months, give or take a week. This is designed to maintain a high velocity and reduce burnout. During each session there are several "sprints" that last from 1 - 3 weeks depending on course difficulty. The object for the sprint methodology is to solely focus on one task at a time, adjust timelines depending on course comprehension, and evaluate what you can do differently for the next "sprint". This process closely matches those of major corporation, which is called "agile", and is vital to every aspiring designer and developer.

* Asset management:
    Assets are organized according to a hierarchy starting with course. Each course has its own folder which contains projects, files, and assigned tags. So, each project contains a file with the same name as the project. Included each project file is a markdown file with the same name as the project. The project file will include the project description, link to the project, state the languages and technologies used, and any other relevant information. In order to quickly find an asset, tags are assigned automatically and grouped dynamically.

### 1.0 Thinking Methods
---

The purpose of this module is to explore different **methods of thinking** for creative problem solving, critical thinking, logic and reasoning, computational thinking, mathematical thinking, and design thinking. It will teach me to think differently depending on the type of problem, learn to collaborate with teams, and provide constructive critisism as well as accept negative critisism. Being able to break down problems and provide solutions is at the heart of every technology, design, and business company in the world. This module should take approximately **__ Weeks** to finish, which includes a final project, technical paper or blog posts, and a certification from IBM, for enterprise design thinking.

* **1.1: Creative Thinking (CSP)**
    - Description: This course will equip you with a 'tool-box', introducing you to a selection of behaviors and techniques that will augment your innate creativity. Some of the tools are suited to use on your own and others work well for a group, enabling you to leverage the power of several minds.

* **1.2: Logic and Reasoning**
    - Description: By taking Introduction to Logic and Critical Thinking you will improve your ability to identify, analyze, and evaluate arguments by other people (including politicians, used car salesmen, and teachers) and also to construct arguments of your own in order to convince others and to help you decide what to believe or do. This specialization introduces general standards of good reasoning and offers tools to improve your critical thinking skills. These skills will help you determine when an argument is being given, what its crucial parts are, and what it assumes implicitly. You will also learn how to apply deductive and inductive standards for assessing arguments and how to detect and avoid fallacies.

* **1.5: Mathematical Thinking**
    - Description: Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics – at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box – a valuable ability in today’s world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.
